Found Issues:
- magic numbers (line 103ff): if IDs of API change, your method is wrong. Use the enums of Color class instead.
Comments:
- don't call main-method of other classes; Task3in3.main() does not tell whats happening
- line 71+72: why seperate variable declaration and definition?
- switch-case in approachWall is not needed and only bloats code.
